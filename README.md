# Customer Segmentation Analysis
The Customer Segmentation Analysis project aims to analyze customer data and segment them into distinct groups based on various attributes. By identifying different customer segments, businesses can better understand their target audience, personalize marketing strategies, and optimize customer experiences.

The analysis focuses on clustering techniques to categorize customers into different segments. The conclusions derived from the clustering analysis provide valuable insights into customer characteristics, including family status, family size, age distribution, presence of teenagers, and income level.

## Key Findings

### Cluster Number 0

- Parental Segment:
  - Customers in this cluster are primarily parents.
  - Family size ranges from 2 to 4 members, with an average of 2-3 members.
  - Single parents are also a subset of this group.
  - Majority of customers in this cluster have teenagers at home.
  - Relatively older customer group.

### Cluster Number 1

- Non-Parental Segment:
  - Customers in this cluster are not parents.
  - Family size is typically small, with a maximum of 2 members.
  - Slight majority of couples over single individuals.
  - Customers in this cluster span all age groups.
  - High-income group.

### Cluster Number 2

- Parental Segment:
  - Majority of customers in this cluster are parents.
  - Family size ranges from 2 to 3 members, with an average of 2-3 members.
  - Customers in this cluster mainly have one child (not teenagers).
  - Relatively younger customer group.

### Cluster Number 3

- Parental Segment:
  - Customers in this cluster are definitely parents.
  - Family size ranges from 2 to 5 members, with an average of 2-3 members.
  - Majority of customers in this cluster have teenagers at home.
  - Relatively older customer group.
  - Lower-income group.
